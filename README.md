# React + TypeScript + SASS + Tailwind

This is a Portfolio Project for Nikoloz Macharahvili. I will be using ReactJS, TypeScript, SASS and Tailwind to create a stock market API. I do not have a backend so I will be generating everything on the front end.

## I will write the documentation for the long 2-3-+ month project as follows

My goal is to create a Stock-Market API, and write the documentation for it here. The steps I took to create this project will be all here, I will be using chatGPT 3.5 for best-practices and code where I fall short.

### The Goal and Steps

So my goal is to create a stock-market API and in here I will write steps for EverDay.
